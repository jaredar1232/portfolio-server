# Portfolio Server


> This is essentially a proxy server that is used to hide my SendGrid credientials. Contact Form queries are sent from my Gatsby server side rendered portfolio to here and then forwarded to the SendGridAPI.

> *Note:* To whom it may concern: this readMe is lacking as this is a simple one off server that will be scrapped at my next portfolio refactoring.
